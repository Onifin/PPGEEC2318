# Model Card - Logistic regression to Alzheimer risk prediction 

## Model Details
The model was created by Ian Antonio Fonseca Araújo and João Vítor de Souza Lopes. A complete data analizys was realized through the data of the dataset located at https://github.com/PATRICK079/Operation-Mind-Shield. 

## Intended Use
This model is used as a proof of concept for the evaluation of Logistic regression based on a atribute set composed of processed data. 

## Training Data
The dataset used in this project is composed of 33 attributes and a label referring to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. 

After the EDA was performed on the data, it was noticed that only 5 attributes had Pearson correlation with the diagnosis. These were the attributes that we considered relevant for training the predictive model. 

All data were normalized using Z-score normalization.
